RideCO QA Screener Test

Name: Naga Sai Jyothi Mullapudi

Program = testme.exe
Coding Platform = python
Experience level = beginner
Test runner used = unittest

Code:
- Had the choice of using os.system or subprocess to run the program
- subprocess was chosen run the program because it was easier to pass in arguments and capture output
- Wrote convenience methods for each different type of test scenerios
- Create UnitTest class and check the result of the above mentioned scenarios using assertions.
- Frameworks used:
	- unittest
	- subprocess
	- random
- String Comparison

Level of Difficulty of the program:
- From the concept point of view it is rather easier
- From my level of knowledge in windows and python coding perspective, it is on a harder scale.

Challenges:
- Learn Python Scripting as I am very new at it
- calling an executable from python
- Capturing output from the executable

Takeaways
- Python programming
- Windows automation
- Opened my mind to new areas as I was very narrowed down to mobile testing
  and manual testing to the most extent in my professional career.
